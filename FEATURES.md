# Features

This document outlines the key features of the storm.dance application based on its current implementation.

## Core Note Management

*   **Create Notes:** Add new, untitled notes with a single click.
*   **Edit Notes:** Modify the title and content of selected notes. The editor supports Markdown.
*   **Delete Notes:** Remove notes individually.
*   **List Notes:** View all existing notes in a sidebar, ordered with the most recent first.
*   **Select Note:** Click a note in the sidebar to load it into the main editor view.

## Storage & UI

*   **Local Persistence:** Notes are stored locally in the browser using IndexedDB, ensuring data remains available between sessions.
*   **Minimalist Interface:** A clean, two-pane layout (sidebar and editor) for focused writing.
*   **Toast Notifications:** Simple feedback messages confirm successful actions (create, delete) or indicate errors.
*   **Responsive Layout:** The interface adapts reasonably to different screen sizes.
